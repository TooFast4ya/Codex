Information about this bot.

Note that this bot is not a moderation bot it's more made for the fun side and exploration. it has a pretty unique command. 

**If you take a look at the project, u will see that there 2 js files. 1 is for just the regular bot and the other has an interesting feature. So the Arduino js file has capabilities of connecting to an Arduino and sending a command over the internet which is pretty cool. It's using the Johnny-Five Libraries.
